    img: GiraffeCenter,
    details: `The Giraffe Centre is located at Langata, approximately 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) from the centre of Nairobi, Kenya. It was established in order to protect the endangered Rothschild giraffe, Giraffa camelopardalis rothschildi, that is found only in the grasslands of East Africa. The Giraffe Centre was started by Jock Leslie-Melville, the Kenyan grandson of a Scottish Earl, when he and his wife Betty captured a baby giraffe to start a programme of breeding giraffe in captivity at their home in Langata - home of the present centre. Since then the programme has had huge success, resulting in the introduction of several breeding pairs of Rothschild Giraffe into Kenyan national parks. In 1979, Leslie-Melville added an education centre to his (then still private) giraffe sanctuary. By 1983 he had raised enough money to establish the Giraffe Visitor's Centre as a tourist destination in Nairobi.`,

    img: DavidShedrickElephantOrphanage,
    details: `Daphne Sheldrick's Elephant Sanctuary - The David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust, a small flexible charity established in the name of the founder Warden of Tsavo East National Park, pioneered the hand-rearing and complicated strategy of successfully rehabilitation of black rhino calves, into established wild rhino communities. They have been responsible for saving many orphaned rhino calves, and their hands on practical experience and inside knowledge of this species is unmatched.

His wife, Daphne Sheldrick, was the first person in the entire world, to successfully hand rear fully milk dependent African Elephant orphans. By 2008, the Trust had successfully raised over 82 infant African Elephant calves. Others are still in the gradual process of reintegration, and others yet are in early infancy at the Daphne Sheldrick Elephant & Rhino Nursery. The Sanctuary has a team of competent Elephant Keepers who take the place of the orphan's lost elephant family, until such time as their transition to the wild herds has been accomplished â€“ this can take up to 10 years, since elephants develop through age progression. In addition to the rearing of orphaned rhinos & elephants, the Trust also contributes to part of the electrical fencing of the northern boundary of the Tsavo National Park, continues to pressure CITES to uphold the ivory ban through aggressive public campaigns, works to repatriate other animal species, runs desnaring operations and a Mobile Veterinary project, as well as establishing many boreholes & windmills and general conservation issues in Tsavo National Park.`,
